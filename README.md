Initially intended for my personal use, but you can try it if you think it might be useful to you.

## Discord clipboard manager

Tired of not being able to synchronise your clipboard across devices? Look no further. With DCM, you will be able to use a private Discord server as your encrypted clipboard manager.

I had enough of using wacky techniques for sharing my clipboard from my Android device to my MacOs computer.

## How to use this

First clone the repo and start a virtual environnement. Add the dependencies with pip and the requirements.txt file.

You will need to create a private server on Discord, add as many bots as you have devices.

Ah, one thing. If you intend to use this on your Android device, make sure to download Termux (F-Droid only!) and Tasker.
